# NAME

Finance::Quote::IEX - (DEPRECATED) Retrieve stock quotes using the IEX API

# VERSION

version 0.001002

# SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;
    my $q = Finance::Quote->new('IEX');
    my %info = Finance::Quote->fetch( 'iex', 'AAPL' );

# DESCRIPTION

This module fetches information from the IEX API.

This module is not loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object. It
must be loaded explicitly by placing `'IEX'` in the argument list to
`Finance::Quote->new()`.

This module provides the `iex` fetch method.

# DEPRECATED

**This module is deprecated. Use [Finance::Quote::IEXCloud](https://metacpan.org/pod/Finance::Quote::IEXCloud) instead.**

**The IEX API removed all non-IEX data in June 2019.**
